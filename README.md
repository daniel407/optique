optique
=======

Optical modeling tool for thin film layer structures. Transmission and reflection spectra can be calculated from thin film interference principles. The calculated spectra can tabulated and exported as csv files.

The core functionality has been established. Stacks for multilayer film systems can be loaded into the application and batch calcuations can be executed.

Further functionality to be added in the near future:
- GUI
- full distinction between layers of coherent and non-coherent contribution (as of now the second lowest layer is used as an incoherent substrate)
- charting and plotting (using JFreeChart)
- reverse engineer and fitting algorithms
- more...
